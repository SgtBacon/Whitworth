You enter Room 111.
"Halt. You have entered the Gateway. What say you?" A man in a toga uniform greets you, holding a spear.
You panic. 
You don't have money for a toll. You wouldn't last in McMillan jail. What will happen now???
You cry. Whole lot of tears. It's not an attractive cry. It may be the ugliest cry you've ever had.
The guy stands there, looking very uncomfortable. 
"Hey buddy, it's alright. You're okay, don't cry, nothing's wrong."
We'll pretend this didn't happen little buddy, just get back to your adventure.
