You cannot enter this room.
You look through the glass and notice gold and silver piled mountains high, waiting for you.
Perhaps you shall return here later, when no one is around.
Hey I'm not saying break in or anything,
but if a little bit of gold goes missing, who would notice?
Press 1 to mark this Room in your memory for later and go back to your adventure.
Press 2 to know that theft is wrong and go back to your adventure.
Press 3 to punch the glass and see if it breaks. Stealth is for wusses.
Press 0 to end the game.
