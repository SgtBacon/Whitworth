You enter Room 114 and almost instantly regret your decision. 
In front of you is about 12 guys with no shame in their underwear.
They are surrounding one other person, who is fully clothed, thankfully, while singing "Happy Birthday".
You have no words. What do you do?
Press 1 to get down to your tighty-whities and join them.
Press 2 to try and rescue the surrounded person.
Press 3 to leave the room.
Press 0 to end the game.
