You enter Room 109. Someone with a crown begins to demand that you bow before the king. 
You decide to bow, as you do not understand the formal government of McMillan yet.
Your new King places a sword against each of your shoulders, declaring 
"You are now Sir McMillan, my new champion! Now go, and extend my rule to all other dorm halls. 
They must feel the glory of Mac within their bones! Go!"
