# Whitworth
Explore Whitworth in a text-adventure game, currently just first floor of McMillan hall. Will continue working on this.
I'm excited to be working on this project and I am hoping that others enjoy it as well.
I have many plans I am hoping to add to the game, and thanks to everyone residing in McMillan hall, I am never out of ideas.
1. Items and inventory
    Keys, swords, maybe armor, healing items, junk.
2. Player health
    Self-explanatory, player should be able to die.
3. Enemies
   I don't want to give away the types of enemies but I want players to be able to explore and fight different things.
4. Boss battles
   Sometimes something happens in Mac that just has to be a boss battle. 107 has a future boss in it.
5. True/False rooms
    Some rooms should only be able to be opened after you complete a certain task.
6. Count rooms
   Everytime you perform an action, add one to count, and if count hits a certain number, new options should appear to the player.
7. More interaction within first floor.
    Couch party, shower party, things like that, will have more interaction.
8. The rest of Mac
    McMillan hall is one of the greatest places on Earth, and I want to share this place with anyone who happens to find this creation.
       Tunnels, basement, second floor, third floor, attic
9. Whitworth as a whole
   Someday I hope to add the rest of Whitworth University to this game.
